# plotXRD
Plot powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns against calculated patterns

The zip folder contains:
- a Jupyter notebook with comments explaining the plotting capabilities
- the .png generated by the code, using the example data below
- two XRD patterns (.txt files) exported from TOPAS following Reitveld Refinements, but with no further processing
- two calculated XRD patterns (.xy files) generated by VESTA, the free software for visualizing crystal structures

VESTA can be found here: http://www.jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/

If you use this code for presentations or publications, please acknowledge my work with something along the lines of
"Thanks to Christopher L. Rom for XRD plotting software (github.com/CLRom)"

Thanks!  Hope this helps!
